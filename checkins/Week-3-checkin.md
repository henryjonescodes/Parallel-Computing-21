#<center>Week 3 Check-In</center>
<center>Your Name Here</center>

## Description:

The purpose of this check-in document is to give you a way to provide a narrative structure to your learning experience, and to to allow you to provide feedback on your course experience.  These check-ins are part of your portfolio!

## Introductions

Tell me more about yourself!  For instance, why are you taking this course?  What are your goals for the course?  Are there specific problems you want to know how to parallelize?

*your answer here*

## Class Format and Pacing

Aside from Thursday's hybrid class (discussed below), how do you feel about the structure and pacing of the class?  Anything I can do to improve your experience?

*your answer here*

## Material

What concepts have we covered so far? Which concepts do you feel you have mastered?  Which do you still struggle with?

## Hybrid Teaching

For the first 2.5 weeks, on-campus students are encouraged to zoom into class for a CS lab, so that they could work on our local machines.  
This past Thursday we had a hybrid class where on-campus students attended from Olin 107 or ISEC051, and remote students zoomed in, but where *I* was physically in Olin 1.  There were definitely some hiccups, but is this the kind of experience you want again (with the bumps smoothed out), or would you prefer the prior more zoom-based model? 

 (I suppose the only thing that really changes is whether I'm in the room or the Zoom screen, but...)

## Most useful non-class-provided resource 

My lectures, slides, and the textbook are the main source of knowledge for this course, but they aren't meant to stand alone.  What other resources have you found online, etc, that helped you better understand class material?  I'd love to be able to share your resources with the rest of the class!

## Availability.

So far I've been making myself available for Drop-in hours 4x a week.  I've also done quite a bit of "ad hoc" meetings as needed.  Are you able to find me when you need me?  If not, how can I be more available?

## Tip Jar

Do you want to give kudos to a classmate who has been particularly helpful or kind lately?  I'll send them anonymous kudos on your behalf.
